// Public types of the ADL queue view: what `client.perpAdlQueue` returns.
//
// An ADL queue view is one side of one perp market's auto-deleveraging queue on one
// chain, read from the chain at one block (`adl.ts`), and followed live from the
// market's MarginBank events (`adlSession.ts`). Its states are the account views'
// states (`../accountView/balancesTypes.ts`). Addresses stay lower-case strings, as the
// account views keep them.
