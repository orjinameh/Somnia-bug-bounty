// Public types of the perp positions view: what `client.accountPositions` returns.
//
// A positions view is one account's open perp positions and cross-margin state on one
// chain, read from the chain at one block. Every figure comes from the MarginBank and
// the perp pools, not from the indexer: the chain's own list of the account's pools is
// complete, and every mark-dependent figure only exists there. Protocol integers are
// `bigint` raw units (SDK-TYPE-007). Addresses stay lower-case strings, as the account
// view's other rows keep them.
