// Public types of the spot orders view: what `client.accountSpotOrders` returns.
//
// A spot orders view is one account's resting spot orders on one chain, read from the
// chain: every spot pool's own list of the account's orders. The list of spot pools is
// market metadata from the indexer; nothing about the account is. A pool whose orders
// cannot be read is named with its error, and its orders are missing, not absent.
// Protocol integers are `bigint` raw units (SDK-TYPE-007). Addresses stay lower-case
// strings, as the account view's other rows keep them.
